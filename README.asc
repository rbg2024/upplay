== Upplay - Qt/X11 UPnP/OpenHome audio Control Point

link:http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/upplay/[*upplay*] is a simple Qt-based
UPnP/OpenHome audio Control Point.

It works on Linux/Unix, and there is also a still slightly experimental
Windows version, see the link:http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/upplay/[Web site]

Upplay was started from the *Sayonara* local player, the UI of which was
reused and pitilessly maimed.

It supports gapless transitions using either *AVTransport* _setNextUri_ or
*OpenHome* _Playlist_, depending on what the device supports (*OpenHome* is
chosen if available).

See the link:http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/upplay/upplay.html[manual]
 
The player is less polished than the best Android/IOS/Mac/Windows one, but
can be useful if you are at your desk Linux PC with no decent control point
around, at least to turn the music off...

I would very much like some help in improving the UI !
