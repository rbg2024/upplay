== Player section

Play, Pause, Stop, Next, Previous, Seek, and Adjust volume. I would guess that
these don't need explanations.

== Playlist section

Playlist entries:

- Double-click entry to play
- Click entry, then click the play button to play
- Select and drag-drop to reorder
- Right click and select 'Remove' to delete current selection

Playlist buttons:

- Playlist modes select how the tracks are sequenced: normal, repeat,
  shuffle.
- Playlist add modes determine how "Send to playlist" from the directory
  browser will affect the playlist. By default, this inserts after the
  current track. You can also choose to Append or Replace, and opt to
  immediately start play for the first of the new tracks.
- The sequential number toggle will show numbers in front of the
  entries. Not too sure what this is good for...

== Directory browser section

The list at the top is a hybrid path/search history section:

 - When you browse a directory tree by clicking on containers, it shows
   your location in the tree.
 - If you perform searches, your search history will be stacked at the end
   of the path. Searches are not nested, and always relative to the closest
   directory earlier in the path. If you click a directory inside the
   search results, it will get stacked, and any further searches will be
   relative to this directory, not the earlier one.

Left-Clicking a track title will send it to the playlist, according to the
current playlist add mode.

Left-Clicking a directory title will get you there.

Right-clicking a track title will propose three actions:

 - Send to playlist: same as left-clicking.
 - Send all to playlist: send all tracks from this directory.
 - Send all from here to playlist: this track and the following ones go to
   the playlist.

Right-clicking a directory (in the list or in the path) will propose two
actions:

- Send to playlist: this is a recursive walk, it will send all tracks from
  the subtree to the playlist. Don't do this at the root of a big tree...
- Open in new tab.

Right-clicking empty space will propose to go back (or up).

Mid-Clicking a directory from the entries list, or a search or directory in
the path at the top will open the element in a new tab. This can be
particularly useful if you want to go back to a previous search without
losing the current display.

`^f` or `/` will open the search panel, `Esc` will close it (or the x-cross
button at the right).

When the search panel opens for the first time, it is in local search
mode. Typing stuff in the entry area will try to locate the same stuff in
the listing. The next/prev buttons will walk the matches, and so will
`F3`/`Shift-F3`.

If your media server supports search, you can toggle local/server search by
typing `^s` or clicking the `Server Search` checkbox. When server search is
active, you can choose the property you will be searching with the combobox
at the right (Artist/Album/Title/Genre).

Not all servers support search (e.g, MediaTomb does not, Minidlna does,
etc.).

== Tab bar section

Clicking the big plus sign will open a new tab. Clicking a tab's cross
sign will close it...


== Menus

File:

- Change Media Renderer will let you do just this. You will see a dialog
  with the list of renderers currently seen on the network. After choosing
  one, you may decide that the current *upplay* playlist will replace the
  one or the new renderer, or be appended to it by checking the appropriate
  places. Double-clicking a renderer will get you there too.
- Save / Load playlist will let you save the current playlist to a local
  file, or load one which you previously saved.

View:  you can elect to hide the right panel (directory listing), change
the color scheme for a dark one and other interesting experiences.

Preferences should be reasonably self-explaining.

And help, there is no help...
