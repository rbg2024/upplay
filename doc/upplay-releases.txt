= Upplay release history

== Version 1.2

- Support for the OpenHome Radio service (e.g. when controlling
  MediaPlayer).
- Support for switching to an arbitrary Source on an OpenHome Renderer.
- New tool for setting up and terminating multiple Linn Songcast
  Sender-Receiver connections.

1.2.9:

- Add entry to directory popup for adjusting sort order without going
  through the main menu.
- Don't show Receiver sources in source list, as nothing useful can be done
  with them.
  
1.2.8:

- Fix issue with accented characters in catalog pane.
- Better use space for displaying artist and album info in playlist.
- Option to avoid trying to effect gapless playing (for renderers which
  have trouble with it).
  
1.2.7:

- Add option to avoid monitoring Content Directory update state as it is
  ennoying with some servers.
- Fix tray icon wheel volume adjustment, mute state.
- Changed seek and volume keyboard accels to not use Alt.

1.2.6:

- Fix stupid bug in renderer selection when openhome filtering was set.

1.2.5:

Actually, this should have been 1.3.0, there are some small functional
changes in addition to bug fixes.

- Add scrolling to the songcast connections dialog. It was difficult to use
  with many devices present.
- Option to only show OpenHome renderers in the Renderer choice dialog
  (avoids bubble upnp servers doublons).
- Fix drag&drop being wrongly initiated in some cases.
- Last.FM scrobbler.
- Font size improvements.

1.2.4:

- Fixes to the AVTransport interface, which had support of a bit of
  neglect. Especially, attaching to a playing renderer did not update the
  status, even when the information was available. Switching from an
  OpenHome renderer to an AVTransport one did not replace the playlist
  object (stayed attached to the OpenHome renderer).

1.2.2/3:

- Improvements to how source switches are handled.
- Choice of network interface in preferences

1.2.1:

- Small fixes for Songcast tool: buttons checked state was not reset.


== Version 1.1

- Tooltips to help read the information in the "currently playing" area.
- Options to add artist information to albums lists, and truncate long artist
  information in track lists.
- Random playing of arbitrary-sized subtrees either as individual tracks or
  as groups/albums
- Windows port in sync with other platforms.

== Version 1.0

Upplay now seems stable, and leaves the 0.x behind. Mostly to make it clear
that upplay and libupnpp versions don't need to stay in lockstep. Upplay
1.0 needs libupnpp 0.11.0 or newer (libupnpp2).

2015-08-16 1.0.0::
- The Playlist context menu now has a "Sort by track number" option.
- New directory sort options
- New logo replacing the Sayonara one.
- The volume slider changes the volume incrementally, not just when released.
- Reconnect to renderer when the connection is lost (e.g. because of a renderer
  restart). Notice the user when this fails.
- Fix shuffle mode (AVTransport renderers).
- MS Windows port.

== Version 0.10

2015-01-21 0.10.0::
- Support pure OpenHome renderers with no UPnP AV services at all, like BubbleUPnP
  Server. This needs libupnpp1 (libupnpp 0.10.0).

== Version 0.9

2014-11-16 0.9.1::
- fix core dump in "add all" on directory with subdirs.

2014-11-12 0.9.0 ::
- Multiple tabs.
- Local and server search.
- Playlist save/load.
- Moving the playlist to another renderer.

== Version 0.8

2014-10-30 0.8.6::
- Save / restore scroll position when moving back in the tree.
- Enable style sheets and switch to dark style.
- Save / restore splitter state between sessions.
- Move playlist insert modes to buttons below the playlist. Keep only the
  track choice in the directory browser popup.
- Fix mute.

2014-10-13 0.8.5:: 
- No changes, released for consistency with the version
  for libupnpp. The latter has been extracted from upmpdcli, and it has no
  stable ABI yet, you need to use the same versions for upplay and libupnpp.

== Version 0.1

2014-10-09 0.1.3::
- Better tree walk with the MinimServer directory service, and other small fixes.

2014-10-07 0.1.2 ::
- Improves a number of things on renderers which are not upmpdcli,
  esp. Volume control (needs libupnpp 0.8.2, which comes with the same
  upmpdcli version), track transitions, etc. Also allows better resizing of
  the main window and its parts.

2014-10-05 0.1.1 ::
- Fixes the disappearing popup bug (directory browser right-click popup
  disappearing after one use with a non-openhome renderer).

2014-09-18 0.1.0::
- A release tarball and an Ubuntu package.
